What does this application do ?

We have developed an application that offers our users 3 different features to meet their needs as much as possible. 
The first is the ability to have information about a particular item, by scanning through our camera a barcode or a QR code. 
The second is access to information about a particular article, this access is made by entering the bar code number of the corresponding article. 
Finally, the last feature is the ability to create a virtual cabinet.
